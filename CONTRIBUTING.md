**Welcome to the GitUp community!** We're excited that you're interested in contributing to this fun & engaging project made exclusively for developers. Your contributions are invaluable in making GitUp a better tool for every developer.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository:** Fork the GitUp repository on GitHub to your own account. This will create a copy of the project where you can make your changes.

2. **Clone Locally:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/GitUp.git
cd GitUp
```

3. **Set Up Environment:** Install the necessary tools and dependencies for the project. Since GitUp uses Bash scripting, ensure you have Bash and other dependencies like `jq` installed. Refer to the project's README for detailed instructions.

## Making Contributions

```

2. **Write Code:** Make your changes and write clean, well-formatted, and well-tested code. Follow the project's coding conventions and style guidelines.

3. **Run Tests:** Ensure that your changes don't break existing functionality by running the project's tests. If you're adding new features, write tests to cover them as well. All tests are located in the `tests/` folder.

## Submitting Your Changes

1. **Commit Changes:** Commit your changes to your local branch:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Clear and concise commit message"
```

2. **Push to Your Fork:** Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub:
